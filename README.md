### Overview

The Crewify App will help businesses manage the jobs that are open for their clients. It will allow workers in the company to keep up with active jobs by logging into a consolidated app to get current and past jobs details. There is a main access page that will allow managers to create a new job, search for current or past jobs and allow you them to access all active jobs so they may maintain and complete that job. This app will replace the need to hand write job locations, and client's info on a piece of paper that may be damaged or lost.

The current culture of passing the job information to the crew is printing out a detailed description of what work is to be completed and where the location of the job is. There are several efficiency problems with this. 

1. If the scope of work is changed the after the crew leaves their morning meeting the Project Manager will have to try to call the crew lead on the way to the job. Since phone use is discouraged while driving this usually results in a voicemail that leads to a game of phone tag between the crew lead and project manager. Delaying the job start time until the two parties connect. 
2. The paper is often lost and or damaged at some point during the day which brings production to a halt until the info can be redistributed. 
3. Addresses and or phone numbers of jobs are often taken from the job paper and then entered into the phone or map app with errors resulting more delays and efficiency expenses. 
4. Customers often call weeks later to address issues about the job or damage to the surrounding property. In this situation we have to rely on employees memory of a job from weeks ago with no paper trail to fall back on.
